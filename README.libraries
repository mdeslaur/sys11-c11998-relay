This project uses the following libraries:

K10P-11D55-24.kicad_mod
K10P-11D55-24.kicad_sym
Molex_KK-396_5273-02A_1x02_P3.96mm_Vertical_mod.kicad_mod
Molex_KK-396_5273-07A_1x07_P3.96mm_Vertical_mod.kicad_mod

The K10P* libraries were originally obtained from Digikey and were modified
to make the solder pads larger.

The Molex libraries are modified versions of the connectors included with
kicad to make the solder pads larger.
